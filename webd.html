<p class="p2">Web application development is the creation of application programs that reside on remote servers and are delivered to the userâ€™s device over the Internet. A web application (web app) does not need to be downloaded and is instead accessed through a network. 

Web application development will typically have a short development life-cycle lead by a small development team. </p>

An end user can access a web application through a web browser such as Google Chrome, Safari, or Mozilla Firefox. A majority of web applications can be written in JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and HTML5.
 Front-end development for web applications is accomplished through client-side programming. Client refers to a computer application such as a web browser. Client-side programming will typically utilize HTML, CSS and JavaScript. HTML programming will instruct a browser how to display the on-screen content of web pages, while CSS keeps displayed information in the correct format.</p>
